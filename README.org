* Common Lisp Text Editor
  Definite work-in-progress


  The idea behind this editor is to make an extremely modular text editor
  framework. Right now, it's rather rough and ready because it's not really
  designed as such and, really, didn't even start as a text editor. Right
  now the guts (~CLED-CORE~) are sorta fleshed out and sorta work (at least
  enough to start really debugging and testing things), but there is no
  interface, is very light by way of features, and is of dubious
  quality. Eventually I hope to make it a bit better and a bit more
  functional, but will never replace real editors.
